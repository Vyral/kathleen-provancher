The first member of my team that I’d like you all to meet is **Shawn Venazio.** On our team, Shawn specializes in residential sales on both the buyer and the seller side. I asked her some offbeat questions so you could get to know her a little better:

**“Puppies or kittens?”***Puppies, definitely.*

**“Favorite vacation spot?”** *Tuscany, Italy.*

**“Your favorite part of being a Realtor?”***My favorite part of being a Realtor is having a happy seller or buyer.*

**“Your favorite part of being on our team?”** *It’s fun, provides a wealth of knowledge, and everybody brings something else to the table on this team. Whenever I need questions asked, all I have to do is pick up the phone and call.*

**“What do you want people to know about you?”***That I am fair, loyal, and honest, and I will definitely do my best to help you in any way.*

***“What’s your favorite day of the week?”*****Sunday, becuase I don’t h*ave to get out of my pajamas until like 10 a.m.!*

**“Text, FaceTime, or email?”***Hmm… I would say text.*

**“Soup or salad?”** *Salad, definitely.*

**“Endless breadsticks: yes or no?”** *No.*

**“What is the last photo in your phone of?”***The last photo in my phone is of my dog, I’m sad to say.*

**“Puppies or kittens?”***Puppies.*

**“Favorite vacation spot?”** *California.*

**“Your favorite part of being a Realtor?”** *My favorite part of being a Realtor is meeting awesome people.*

**“Your favorite part of being on our team?”** *Lunch dates!*

**“What do you want people to know about you?”***That I am honest, fun, knowledgeable, and that I like to laugh.*

**“Text, FaceTime, or email?”** *Text.*

**“Soup or salad?”** *Salad, definitely.*

**“Endless breadsticks: yes or no?”***No—too many carbs!*

Last but not least to answer my rapid-fire questions is Martha **Sue Gallaher.**
