Making sure buyers perceive your home in the best possible light means getting inside the mind of a buyer, and here’s how you do that.&nbsp;

First, **drive up to your home and pretend you’re a buyer.** Park in the driveway, look at the lanterns on each side of the garage, and make sure you don’t see any chipped paint and the lanterns look nice and new.&nbsp;

Then, **walk up to your front door and make sure you have fresh flowers set about and the paint on the front door looks fresh.** This is the time during a showing when the buyer’s agent is unlocking the front door and their client is looking around the exterior for any signs of wear and tear that they’ll have to take care of if they decide to buy. Everything they see has to look well maintained. When adding a fresh layer of paint to the front door, don’t forget to choose a color with curb appeal.&nbsp;

When a buyer walks into your home, they’ll make a decision within the first three steps they take. You only have one chance to make a great first impression, so make sure your home smells nice and new and there’s no clutter in the entryway.&nbsp;

Buyers coming down from the Northeast, especially, are looking for homes that offer the typical Florida lifestyle (i.e., ones that open up to a pool and lanai area), so if you have an open-concept floor plan and a pool and lanai area in the backyard, keep the path to the outside open. That’s the first thing they should see when they step inside. &nbsp;
