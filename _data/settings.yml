  about_markdown: >
    After graduating from Binghamton University with a degree in Psychology, I
    went on to earn my Professional Pilot Certifications through Jacksonville
    University. My husband and I have been avid real estate investors since
    1998. Formerly with another brokerage, I was a part of their #1 real estate
    team. I then went on to join Dale Sorensen Real Estate, where I continue to
    bring my clients the best possible service and marketing. I am active in
    numerous children's charities, as well. My husband Todd, a pilot with
    Southwest Airlines, and I reside on the barrier island with our two
    children.
