Having your own place to call your home is something to be proud of. If you're having a hard time to decide whether to make your first home purchase, you've probably researched or asked your friends and family, many of whom are encouraging you to buy a home. That being said, you may still have second thoughts if buying a home is the right thing to do.

Hesitation is normal as this is a big decision to make but the more you know why you should own a home, the less hesitant you'll be. To help you decide, we listed the benefits of owning your own house.

When you're renting a home, you don't have exclusive rights to the property. This means that the landlord or his/her employees may enter at any time, thus, making the property less private and secured.

Owning your own home means that you alone make the rules of entry. No one has the right to enter it without your permission. You may also add security systems to your home so you can rest easy even when you're out.

## **2\. Financial Investment**

Although real estate value moves in a cycle, housing values is constantly appreciating. In fact, a double-digit increase in home values was observed last year. Even if you don't plan to stay in the house for the longest time, buying one is a big financial investment for the future.
