Shannon Pohl is the producing branch manager of Caliber Home Loans right here in Vero Beach. Because we love our veterans, she’s here today to help me educate you all about the VA home loan.

Caliber Home Loans is a leader in the industry for serving our veterans who have served us, and they pride themselves on doing well for them. VA loans are great 100% financing options for veterans; if you have a disability as a veteran, no funding fee will be applied to you.

To be eligible, a veteran must have a DD Form 214, or a certificate of eligibility, which Shannon can pull in her office. If there are any issues or questions, she can work with the VA to iron those out. Especially with online companies, getting a certificate of eligibility can be difficult, but as a listing agent, I will tell you that Caliber Home Loans does make it easy.

**There’s a lot to love about VA home loans:**

1\. If a veteran needs to pay off a credit card to qualify, the seller could provide them with unlimited closing cost assistance.<br><br>2\. A veteran’s spouse can be the occupying owner of the property; the family of a veteran can purchase a new home using a VA loan.<br><br>3\. You can have more than one\! Because there is a minimum loan amount for the second loan, your entitlement will allow you to get a second VA loan. It must be for a primary residence; if you move from one home to another but still own the first as a departing home or investment, the second home would count as your primary residence.<br><br>4\. Compared to the conventional loan, a VA loan requires no private mortgage insurance, which is a huge savings for veterans. Appraisal requirements for VA loans are similar to conventional or FHA loans, but qualifying for VA loans is actually easier. They’re also more flexible.

Many listing agents aren’t really familiar with VA loans, which can cause some veterans to be hesitant about them. So if you’re a listing agent who isn’t sure about how to handle a VA loan offer for your seller, reach out to Shannon and Caliber Home Loans at (772) 360-6030. **She can talk to you about your concerns and clear up any misunderstandings.**
