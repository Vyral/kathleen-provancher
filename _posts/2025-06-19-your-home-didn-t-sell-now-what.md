# Your Home Didn’t Sell – Now What?

When your home doesn’t sell, it’s more than disappointing—it’s emotional. You invested time, money, and heart into this move. You shared the news with friends and family. And when the listing expires without an offer? It’s easy to feel stuck, frustrated, and even a little embarrassed.

Here’s what most agents won’t say:<br>**Over 70% of homeowners who re-list with a different agent successfully sell their home.**

Stick with the same agent? That success rate drops to just 50%, according to recent data from REDX. That’s like flipping a coin with your future on the line—and you deserve better odds.

Even more surprising? Only 1 in 3 homeowners with an expired listing make the switch. The rest either give up or try the same strategy again... and get the same result.

**Same house. Smarter approach. Better outcome.**<br>Let’s take a closer look at what may have gone wrong—and how a fresh strategy can turn it around.

### 1\. The Price Missed the Market

In today’s market, buyers are navigating higher interest rates and tighter budgets. Even a slightly overpriced home can sit unnoticed—and once it goes stale, it’s hard to get buyers excited again.

**What to do now:**<br>We’ll review current local sales, buyer feedback, and real-time market behavior to set a competitive price. Pricing your home just right—or even just under market value—can attract more interest and spark competition.

### 2\. The Presentation Fell Flat

First impressions matter. If the listing photos didn’t shine, the staging felt dated, or the condition needed work, buyers may have scrolled right past—or left showings unimpressed by details like chipped paint or old light fixtures.

**What to do now:**<br>Let’s walk through the home with a buyer’s eye. Small updates—fresh paint, updated lighting, decluttering, or light staging—can transform the way buyers feel the moment they walk in.

### 3\. It Wasn’t Marketed to the Right Audience

If all you had was a sign in the yard, some flyers, and a basic online listing, it’s no surprise your home didn’t get traction. Today’s buyers live online—and smart marketing meets them there.

**What to do now:**<br>We’ll craft a full marketing plan that includes professional photography, video, targeted digital ads, social media strategy, and personalized outreach to put your home in front of the right buyers at the right time.

### 4\. There Was No Room to Negotiate

Buyers in this market expect some flexibility. If you weren’t open to negotiating on repairs, closing costs, or timelines, that might’ve stopped the deal before it started. And if your last agent didn’t prep you for that? That’s a missed opportunity.

**What to do now:**<br>Let’s talk strategy. You may be in a strong equity position—home values have risen over 55% in the last five years—so there may be room to negotiate without losing value. The goal is to close, and sometimes that means getting creative.

### Bottom Line

If your home didn’t sell the first time, it doesn’t mean it won’t sell. It just means it’s time for a new game plan—and a partner who knows how to execute it.

Over 70% of sellers who switch agents go on to close successfully. That’s not luck. That’s results-driven strategy.
