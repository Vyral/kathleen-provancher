As&nbsp;[rent prices](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/with-rents-on-the-rise-is-now-the-time-to-buy/)&nbsp;continue to soar, many renters want to know what they can do to get ready to buy their first home. According to recent data from&nbsp;[*ApartmentList.com*](https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/national-rent-data){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

Those rising rental costs may make it seem impossible to prepare for homeownership if you’re a renter. But the truth is, there are ways you can – and should – prepare to purchase your first home. Here’s some expert advice on what to do if you’re ready to learn more about how to escape rising rents.

## **Start Saving – Even Small Amounts – Now**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Experts agree, setting aside what you can – even smaller amounts of money – into a dedicated savings account is a great starting point when it comes to saving for a down payment. As Cindy Zuniga-Sanchez, Founder of&nbsp;*Zero-Based Budget Coaching LLC*,&nbsp;[says](https://www.today.com/tmrw/how-save-home-deposit-get-house-your-dreams-t218825){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“I recommend saving for a home in a ‘sinking fund’ . . . .&nbsp;**This is a savings account separate from your emergency fund that you use to save for a short or mid-term expense**.*”<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Zuniga-Sanchez adds saving in smaller increments can help make a large goal – such as saving for a down payment –achievable:

## **Assess Your Finances and Work on Your Credit**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Another tip experts recommend: take a look at your overall finances and credit score and find ways to reduce your debt. According to the&nbsp;[HUD](https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/HUD_HC_FirstTimeCredit101.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, the average credit score of first-time homebuyers is 716. If you’re not sure what your credit score is, there are numerous online tools that can help you check. If your score is below that average, don’t fret. Remember that an average means there are homeowners with credit scores both above and below that threshold.

If you find out your score is below the average, there are several ways to improve your credit before you apply for a loan. HUD recommends reducing your debt as much as you can, paying your bills on time, and using your credit card responsibly.

## **Start the Conversation with Your Advisor Today**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

As Lauren Bringle, Accredited Financial Advisor with&nbsp;*Self Financial,&nbsp;*[says](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/05/25/four-tips-become-homeowner-despite-low-income/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->
