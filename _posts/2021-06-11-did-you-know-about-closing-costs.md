# **What are Closing Cost?**

According to [*Trulia*](https://www.trulia.com/guides/mortgage-terms/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}\:&nbsp;

“*When you close on a home, a number of fees are due. They typically range from 2% to 5% of the total cost of the home, \*\*and can include title insurance, origination fees, underwriting fees, document preparation fees, and more*.”

For example, for someone buying a $300,000 home, they could potentially have between $6,000 and $15,000 in closing fees. If you’re in the market for a home above this price range, your closing costs could be greater. As mentioned above,&nbsp;**closing costs are typically between 2% and 5% of your purchase price.****&nbsp;**

Trulia gives us more great advice saying:&nbsp;

*“There will be lots of paperwork in front of you on closing day, and not enough time to read them all. Work closely with your real estate agent, lender, and attorney, if you have one, to get all the documents you need ahead of time.*

The most important thing to read is the closing disclosure, which shows your loan terms, final closing costs, and any outstanding fees. You’ll get this form about three days before closing since, once you (the borrower) sign it, there’s a three-day waiting period before you can sign the mortgage loan docs. If you have any questions about the numbers or what any of the mortgage terms mean, this is the time to ask—your real estate agent is a great resource for getting you all the answers you need.”

## **SUMMARY**

As home prices are rising and more buyers are finding themselves competing in bidding wars, it’s more important than ever to make sure your plan includes budgeting for closing costs. Let’s connect to be sure you have everything you need to land your dream home.
