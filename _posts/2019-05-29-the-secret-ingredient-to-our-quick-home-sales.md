  An MIT study I recently read said that online, you have 13 milliseconds to

**One of the things that sets our team apart is that we have a quality, professional photographer on staff.** But why would it matter that we have one of the best architectural and interior photographers in the area available to you?&nbsp;

Recently, we sold a house that had been listed everywhere online, including the popular sites Zillow and Trulia. That house sold, sight unseen, within 24 hours **based on the photos alone— it sold that quickly\!**

In a lot of different areas and markets, **our listings are the No. 1 view on Zillow and Trulia,** and we get more views because of our professional photography and the composition thereof.

An MIT study I recently read said that online, you have 13 milliseconds to catch someone’s eye with your photography, or you’ll risk them scrolling on past your listing.

When you work with Provancher Group Real Estate, the services of our on-staff photographer are free to you, along with many other internet resources that we would like to share with you. Our team is No. 1 in Indian County because **we go out of our way to make sure that your every need is met.**

If you’ve been thinking of selling your home and would like to see the power of our professional photographer firsthand, reach out to us. We would love to discuss the best strategy to list your home quickly and for more money. Hope to hear from you soon\!
