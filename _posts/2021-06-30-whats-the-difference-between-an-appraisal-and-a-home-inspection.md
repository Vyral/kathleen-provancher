An&nbsp;**appraisal&nbsp;**is an important step of home buying. It’s a professional evaluation of the market value of the house that you’d like to buy. Normally, an appraisal is ordered by the lender to confirm the true value of the home prior to lending money to the buyer for the purchase. On the other hand,&nbsp;**home inspection**&nbsp;is an assessment of the condition of the home before you finalize the transaction. Although they are different, both are vital processes when buying a home. Here’s why:

## **Home Appraisal**

The&nbsp;*National Association of Realtors&nbsp;*(NAR)&nbsp;[explains](https://www.nar.realtor/appraisal-valuation/residential-appraisal-process-for-home-buyers){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> ***“A home purchase is typically the largest investment someone will make. Protect yourself by getting your investment appraised\!****&nbsp;An appraiser will observe the property, analyze the data, and report their findings to their client. For the typical home purchase transaction, the lender usually orders the appraisal to assist in the lender’s decision to provide funds for a mortgage.”*

When you apply for a mortgage, an unbiased appraisal (which is required by the lender) is the best way to confirm the value of the home based on the sale price. Regardless of what you’re willing to pay for a house, if you’ll be using a mortgage to fund your purchase, the appraisal will help make sure the bank doesn’t loan you more than what the home is worth.

This is especially critical in today’s&nbsp;[sellers’ market](https://www.mykcm.com/2020/12/10/why-it-makes-sense-to-sell-your-house-this-holiday-season/)&nbsp;where low&nbsp;[inventory](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/01/14/why-right-now-may-be-the-time-to-sell-your-house/)&nbsp;is driving an increase in&nbsp;[bidding wars](https://www.mykcm.com/2020/10/16/how-to-prepare-for-a-bidding-war-infographic/), which can push home&nbsp;[prices](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/01/11/what-does-2021-have-in-store-for-home-values/)&nbsp;upward. When sellers are in a strong position like this, they tend to believe they can set whatever price they want for their house under the assumption that competing buyers will be willing to pay more.

However, the lender will only allow the buyer to borrow based on the value of the home. This is what helps keep home prices in check. If there’s ever any confusion or discrepancy between the appraisal and the sale price, your trusted real estate professional will help you navigate any additional negotiations in the buying process.

## **Home Inspection**

Here’s the key difference between an appraisal and an inspection.&nbsp;*MSN*&nbsp;[explains](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/what-is-a-home-appraisal-everything-you-need-to-know/ar-BB17nckC?fbclid=IwAR2hDqkZowDqKWBcb7DxAI_iy37ONH_n3-B1XBOYdN0_resgnZr163iZ9j0){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“**In simplest terms, a home appraisal determines the value of a home, while a home inspection determines the condition of a home.”***

The home&nbsp;[inspection](https://www.mykcm.com/2019/10/01/what-to-expect-from-your-home-inspection-2/)&nbsp;is a way to determine the current state, safety, and condition of the home before you finalize the sale. If anything is questionable in the inspection process – like the age of the roof, the state of the HVAC system, or just about anything else – you as a buyer have the option to discuss and negotiate any potential issues or repairs with the seller before the transaction is final. Your real estate agent is a key expert to help you through this part of the process.
