We saw a significant increase in home pricing and real estate properties over the last year, which led to a higher net worth for the homeowners. Appreciation and home equity are directly linked – as the value appreciates, so does a homeowner’s equity. And with this recent gains, home owners are experiencing financial stability and well-being on record levels.

Furthermore, the most recent Home Price Expectations Survey(a survey of a national panel of over one hundred economist, real estate experts, and investment and market strategists)&nbsp;[**forecasts**](https://pulsenomics.com/surveys/#home-price-expectations){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;home prices will continue appreciating over the next five years\! Adding to the record amount of equity homeowners have already gained over the past year.

## **What Does This Mean For The Homeowners**

*CoreLogic*&nbsp;recently released their quarterly&nbsp;[*Homeowner Equity Insights Report*](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/homeowner-equity-insights/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}*,*&nbsp;which tracks the year-over-year increases in equity. It shows an average&nbsp;**annual gain of $33,400 per borrower over the past 12 months**. In the report, Dr. Frank Nothaft, Chief Economist for*&nbsp;CoreLogic*, further explains:

> *“**Double-digit home price growth in the past year has bolstered home equity to a record amount.&nbsp;**The national CoreLogic Home Price Index recorded an 11.4% rise in the year through March 2021, leading to a $216,000 increase in the average amount of equity held by homeowners with a mortgage.”*

It is expected that homeowners will continue to build on the past year’s record levels of home equity and have a sustained growth of home prices and their financial prosperity. This also represents today’s homeowners with a unique opportunity: using their growing equity for a home upgrade.
