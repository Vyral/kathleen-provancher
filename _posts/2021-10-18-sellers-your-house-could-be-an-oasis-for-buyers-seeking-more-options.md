Sellers have a great opportunity this season as buyer demand still heavily outweighs the current supply of homes for sale. According to the&nbsp;[*National Association of Realtors*](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics/existing-home-sales){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;(NAR), today’s housing inventory sits at only a 2.6-month supply. To put that into perspective, a neutral market typically features a 6-month supply.**&nbsp;That places today’s market firmly in the&nbsp;**[**sellers’ market**](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/what-does-being-in-a-sellers-market-mean/)**&nbsp;category**.

That same NAR data also shows today’s inventory of single-family homes is trailing behind the level we saw last year&nbsp;*(see graph below)*\:Because of the ongoing supply challenges, buyers can feel like they’re wandering across a vast, empty desert when searching for their next home.&nbsp;**That means your house could provide an oasis for&nbsp;**[**buyers**](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/the-truth-about-todays-buyer-demand/)**&nbsp;thirsty for options&nbsp;**– and it could increase the chances of buyers entering a bidding war for your home.

The latest&nbsp;[*Realtors Confidence Index Survey*](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-08-realtors-conference-index-09-22-2021_0.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;from NAR shows houses are&nbsp;**receiving an average of 3.8 offers**. A multiple-offer scenario lets you select the best offer and gives you incredible leverage when you sell this&nbsp;[fall](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/09/07/reasons-you-should-consider-selling-this-fall/).

### **Bottom Line**

<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Buyers today are looking for relief as they wander today’s inventory desert. Listing your house this fall – before more options appear – gives your house the best chance to be noticed by multiple buyers. Let’s connect today so your house can stand out as the oasis it truly is.
