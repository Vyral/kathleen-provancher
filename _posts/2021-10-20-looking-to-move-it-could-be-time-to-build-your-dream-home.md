While today’s&nbsp;[supply](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/10/06/what-do-supply-and-demand-tell-us-about-todays-housing-market/)&nbsp;of homes for sale is still low, the number of&nbsp;**newly built homes is increasing**. If you’re&nbsp;[ready to sell](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/is-it-time-to-move-on-to-a-new-home/)&nbsp;but have held off because you weren’t sure you’d be able to find a home to move into, newly built homes and those under construction can provide the options you’ve been waiting for.

The latest&nbsp;[*Census*](http://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;data shows the inventory of new homes is increasing this year&nbsp;*(see graph below)*\:With more new homes coming to the market, this means you’ll have more options to choose from if you’re ready to buy. Of course, if you do consider a newly built home, you’ll want to keep timing in mind. The supply shown in the graph above includes homes at various stages of the construction process – some are near completion while others may be months away.

According to Robert Dietz, Chief Economist and Senior VP for Economics and Housing Policy for the&nbsp;[*National Association of Home Builders*](https://eyeonhousing.org/2021/09/uptick-for-new-home-sales-in-august/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;(NAHB):

> *“**28% of new home inventory consists of homes that have not started construction**, compared to 21% a year ago.”*

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Buying a home near completion is great if you’re ready to move. Alternatively, a home that has yet to break ground might benefit you if you’re ready to sell and you aren’t on a strict timeline. You’ll have an&nbsp;**even greater opportunity to design your future home to suit your needs**. No matter what, your trusted real estate advisor can help you find a home that works for you.
