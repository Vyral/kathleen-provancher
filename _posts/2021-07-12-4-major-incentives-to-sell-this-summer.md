The housing market forecast for the&nbsp;[second half](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/what-do-experts-see-on-the-horizon-for-the-second-half-of-the-year/)&nbsp;of the year remains positive. You might be thinking “I’ll wait until I can get more profit from selling my house”, but there may not be a better time to sell than right now\! We listed four things to consider if you’re trying to decide if you want to make the move now.

## **1\. Your House Will Likely Sell Quickly**

With the current real estate market state, house are flying off the shelves quickly. Record-low house for sale inventory partnered with high buyer demand gives your house a better chance of selling more faster now than later. According to the most recent&nbsp;[*Realtors Confidence Index*](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/realtors-confidence-index){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;released by the&nbsp;*National Association of Realtors&nbsp;*(NAR),&nbsp;**homes are selling in an average of just 17 days**.

Average days on market is a great indicator of buyer competition, and homes that gets sold quickly is a great sign for sellers. This is a factor that tells us that buyers are motivated to do whatever it takes to purchase the home they have dreamt of.

## **2\. Buyers Are Willing To Compete for Your House**

On top of selling homes faster, they also get multiple offers. This confirms buyers are ready and willing to enter&nbsp;[bidding wars](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/21/5-things-homebuyers-need-to-know-when-making-an-offer/)&nbsp;for your home. Receiving several offers on your house means you can select the one that&nbsp;**makes the most sense for your situation and financial well-being.**&nbsp;NAR&nbsp;[reports](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/realtors-confidence-index){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;sellers are seeing**&nbsp;an average of 5 offers**, and these offers are competitive ones. Shawn Telford, Chief Appraiser at*&nbsp;CoreLogic*,&nbsp;[said](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/homebuyers-increasingly-willing-to-pay-above-asking-price/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;in a recent interview:

> *“**The frequency of buyers being willing to pay more than the market data supports is increasing.**”*

## **3\. When Supply Is Low, Your House Is in the Spotlight**

One of the most significant challenges for motivated buyers is the current inventory of homes for sale, which while improving, remains at near-record lows. As NAR&nbsp;[details](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/22/2251149/0/en/Existing-Home-Sales-Experience-Slight-Skid-of-0-9-in-May.html){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“Total housing inventory at the end of May amounted to 1.23 million units, up 7.0% from April’s inventory and down 20.6% from one year ago (1.55 million).&nbsp;**Unsold inventory sits at a 2.5-month supply at the present sales pace, marginally up from April’s 2.4-month supply but down from 4.6-months in May 2020.”***

There are signs, however, that more homes are coming to market. Odeta Kushi, Deputy Chief Economist at&nbsp;*First American*,&nbsp;[notes](https://twitter.com/odetakushi/status/1407344750534041615){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“It looks like existing inventory is&nbsp;**starting to inch up, which is good news for a housing market parched for more supply.**”*

If you’re looking to take advantage of buyer demand and get the most&nbsp;[attention](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/05/13/your-house-could-be-the-oasis-in-an-inventory-desert/)&nbsp;for your house, selling now before more listings come to the market might be your best option.

## **4\. If You’re Thinking of Moving Up, Now May Be the Time**

Over the past 12 months, homeowners have gained a significant amount of wealth through growing equity. In that same period, homeowners have also spent a considerable amount of time in their homes, and many have decided their house doesn’t meet their needs.

If you’re not happy with your current home,&nbsp;**you can leverage that equity to power your move now.**&nbsp;Your equity, plus current low mortgage rates, can help you maximize your purchasing power.

But these near-historic low rates won’t last forever. Experts forecast interest rates will increase in the coming months. Nadia Evangelou, Senior Economist and Director of Forecasting at NAR*,&nbsp;*[says](https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/instant-reaction-mortgage-rates-june-17-2021){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“Nevertheless, as the economic outlook for the United States looks brighter for the rest of the year,&nbsp;**mortgage rates are expected to rise in the following months**.”*

As interest rates rise, even modestly, it could influence buyer demand and your purchasing power.&nbsp;**If you’ve been waiting for the best time to sell to fuel your move up, you likely won’t find more favorable conditions than those we’re seeing today.**

## **Summary**

With supply challenges, low mortgage rates, and extremely motivated buyers, sellers are well-positioned to take advantage of current market conditions right now. If you’re thinking about selling, let’s connect today to discuss why it makes sense to list your home sooner rather than later
