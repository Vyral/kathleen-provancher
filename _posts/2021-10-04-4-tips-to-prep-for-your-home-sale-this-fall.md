Even in a hot&nbsp;[sel](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/09/24/its-still-a-sellers-market-infographic/)[l](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/its-still-a-sellers-market/)[ers’ market](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/09/24/its-still-a-sellers-market-infographic/)&nbsp;like today’s in which homes are selling so quickly, it’s still important to make a good first impression on potential buyers. Taking the time upfront to prep your house appropriately can bring in the greatest return on your investment.

Here are four simple tips to make sure you maximize the sale of your house this&nbsp;[fall](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/reasons-you-should-consider-selling-this-fall/).

### **1\. Price It Right**

One of the first things buyers will notice is the price of your house. That’s why it’s important to&nbsp;[price it right](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/09/03/your-agent-is-key-when-pricing-your-house-infographic/). Your goal in pricing your house is to draw attention from competing buyers and let bidding wars push the final sales price up. Pricing your house too high to begin with could put you at a disadvantage by discouraging buyers from making an offer.

Your trusted real estate advisor can help you find the price for your home that reflects the current market value. Lean on your agent to help you with this crucial first step.

### **2\. Keep It Clean**

It may sound simple, but keeping your house clean is key to making sure it gets the attention it deserves. As&nbsp;*realtor.com*&nbsp;says in the&nbsp;[*Home Selling Checklist*](https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/home-selling-checklist-things-to-do-before-selling/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“When selling your home, it’s important to keep everything tidy for buyers. . . . Remember to take special care with the bathroom, making sure the tile, counters, shower, and floors shine.”*

Before each buyer visits, assess your space and determine what needs your&nbsp;[attention](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/your-checklist-to-get-ready-to-sell/). Wash the dishes, make the beds, and put away any toys. Doing these simple things can reduce any potential distractions for buyers.

### **3\. Make It Easy To Visit**

Giving buyers the opportunity to see your house on their schedule can be a true game-changer. Buyers are less likely to make an offer if it’s difficult to plan a tour or they can’t easily fit it into their schedule. Making your house available as often as possible helps create opportunities for more buyers to fall in love with your house.

Rest assured your trusted real estate advisor will keep your health and&nbsp;[safety top of mind](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/why-its-still-safe-to-sell-your-home/)&nbsp;when buyers tour your home. Agents use the latest guidance to stay up to date on any protocols and sanitization recommendations.

### **4\. Help Buyers Feel at Home**

Finally, it’s important for buyers to see all the possible ways they can make your house their next home. As the&nbsp;*realtor.com*&nbsp;article puts it:

> *“The goal is to create a blank canvas on which buyers can project their own visions of living there, and loving it.”*

An easy first step to create this blank canvas is removing personal items – pictures, awards, and sentimental belongings – from your space. If you’re unsure what should be packed away and what can stay, consult your trusted real estate advisor. Spending the time on this step can pay off in the long run, as the&nbsp;[*2021 Profile of Home Staging*](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-profile-of-home-staging-report-04-06-2021.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;from the&nbsp;*National Association of Realtors*&nbsp;notes:

> *“Eighteen percent of sellers’ agents said home staging&nbsp;**increased the dollar value of a residence between 6% and 10%.”***
