## **Sell and Move Up (or Downsize)**

Many of today’s homeowners are rethinking what they need in a home and redefining what their&nbsp;[dream home](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/03/dreaming-of-a-bigger-home-why-not-buy-it-this-year/)&nbsp;means. For some, continued remote work is bringing about the need for additional space. For others, moving to a lower cost-of-living area or downsizing may be great options. If you’re considering either of these, there may not be a better time to move. Here’s why.

The chart below shows average&nbsp;[mortgage rates](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;by decade compared to where they are today:**Today’s rates are below 3%,&nbsp;**but&nbsp;[experts forecast](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/30/what-do-experts-see-on-the-horizon-for-the-second-half-of-the-year/)&nbsp;rates to rise over the next few years.

If the interest rate on your current mortgage is higher than today’s average, take advantage of this opportunity by making a move and securing a lower rate.&nbsp;[Lower rates](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/04/21/planning-to-move-you-can-still-secure-a-low-mortgage-rate-on-your-next-home/)&nbsp;mean you may be able to get more house for your money and still have a lower monthly mortgage payment than you might expect.

Waiting, however, might mean you miss out on this historic opportunity. Below is a chart showing how your monthly payment will change if you buy a home as mortgage rates increase:

##### **Breaking It All Down:**

Using the chart above, let’s look at the breakdown of a $300,000 mortgage:

* When mortgage rates rise,&nbsp;**so does the monthly payment&nbsp;**you can secure.
* Even&nbsp;**the smallest increase in rates can make a difference**&nbsp;in your monthly mortgage payment.
* As interest rates rise, you’ll need to look at&nbsp;**a lower-priced home**&nbsp;to try and keep the same target monthly payment,&nbsp;**meaning you may end up with less home for your money.**

No matter what, whether you’re looking to make a&nbsp;[move up](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/11/have-your-day-in-the-sun-by-moving-up-this-summer-infographic/)&nbsp;or&nbsp;[downsize](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/04/13/some-buyers-prefer-smaller-homes/)&nbsp;to a home that better suits your needs,&nbsp;**now is the time**. Even a small change in interest rates can have a big impact on your purchasing power.

#### **Refinance**

If making a move right now still doesn’t feel right for you, consider refinancing. With the current low mortgage rates, refinancing is a great option if you’re looking to&nbsp;**lower your monthly payments and stay in your current home.**
