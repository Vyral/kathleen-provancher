Today Amy Speak from CenterState Bank is here with me and Shawn Venazio to talk a little bit about physician loans. Shawn is actually married to a physician and has worked with Amy for a long time, as have many of her clients.

Amy and CenterState Bank offer 100% financing loans for doctors on loans up to $2.5 million. The great thing about these loans is that they don’t carry private mortgage insurance, which makes them cheaper than most down payment options. These loans can also close in 30 days or less as well.

They offer 30-year fixed, 20-year fixed, and adjustable-rate loans. They can even get loans for secondary homes or condos as well.

The minimum credit score for these loans is 700, but there are no wait limits as long as you’re a licensed physician.&nbsp;

If you have any questions for Amy, give her a call at (772) 234-7877 or send her an email to [Amy.Speak@centerstatebank.com](mailto:Amy.Speak@centerstatebank.com).

If you have any other questions for me in the meantime, don't hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
