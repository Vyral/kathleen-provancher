There are many headlines out there that claim we’re reverting to a more normal real estate market. That would indicate the housing market is returning to the pre-pandemic numbers we saw from 2015-2019. But that’s not happening. The market is still extremely vibrant as demand is still strong even while housing supply is slowly returning.

Here’s the&nbsp;[definition of normal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/normal){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;from the&nbsp;*Merriam-Webster Dictionary*\:

> *“conforming to a type, standard, or regular pattern: characterized by that which is considered&nbsp;**usual, typical, or routine.**”*

Using this definition, here are five housing industry metrics that prove we’re nowhere near normal.

#### **1\. Mortgage Rates**

If we look at the&nbsp;[30-year mortgage rate](http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;chronicled by&nbsp;*Freddie Mac*, we can see the average rates by decade:

* 1970s: 8.86%
* 1980s: 12.7%
* 1990s: 8.12%
* 2000s: 6.29%
* 2010s: 4.09%

Today, the average mortgage rate stands at 2.87%, which is very close to the historic low.

##### Currently, mortgage rates are anything but&nbsp;***usual, typical, or routine.***

#### **2\. Home Price Appreciation**

According to&nbsp;*Black Knight*, a housing data and analytics company, the&nbsp;[average annual appreciation](https://cdn.blackknightinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/BKI_MM_Feb2021_Report.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;on residential real estate prices since 1995 has been 4.14%.

According to the&nbsp;[latest forecast](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/forecast-q3-2021-us-economic-outlook-07-29-2021_1.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;from the&nbsp;*National Association of*&nbsp;*Realtors*&nbsp;(NAR), home price appreciation will hit 14.1% this year, which will be greater than any year since&nbsp;*Black Knight*&nbsp;began collecting this data.

##### Currently, home price appreciation is anything but&nbsp;***usual, typical, or routine***.

#### **3\. Months’ Supply of Inventory (Homes for Sale)**

According to&nbsp;[NAR](https://www.nar.realtor/blogs/economists-outlook/inventory-and-months-supply){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“Months’ supply refers to the number of months it would take for the current inventory of homes on the market to sell given the current sales pace.&nbsp;**Historically, six months of supply is associated with moderate price appreciation**, and a lower level of months’ supply tends to push prices up more rapidly.”*

As of the latest&nbsp;*[Existing Homes Sales Report](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-climb-2-0-in-july){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}*&nbsp;from NAR, the current months’ supply of inventory stands at 2.6. That’s less than half of a normal supply.

##### Currently, the supply of homes for sale is anything but&nbsp;***usual, typical, or routine***.

#### **4\. Days It Takes To Sell a Home**

The&nbsp;[days-on-market metric](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/realtors-confidence-index){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;gives an indication of how hot a market is and how quickly homes are selling. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, the average days on market stood at 35, according to NAR. Today, that number is cut in half and is now at 17 days.

##### Currently, the days-on-market metric is anything but&nbsp;***usual, typical, or routine***.

#### **5\. Number of Offers per Listing**

According to NAR, the&nbsp;[number of offers per listing](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-07-realtors-confidence-index-08-23-2021.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;stood at 2.2 in 2019. Today, that number is double at 4.5.

##### Currently, the number of offers per listing is anything but&nbsp;***usual, typical, or routine***.

### **Bottom Line**

When…

1. Mortgage rates are near historic lows
2. Price appreciation is at historic highs
3. Housing inventory is less than half of the normal amount
4. The time it takes to sell a home is cut in half, and
5. There are twice as many offers on each house

…it’s hard to say we’re in a normal market.
