There’s a lot of talk lately about how challenging it can be to find a home to buy. While housing inventory is still low, there are a few important things to understand about the&nbsp;[supply](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/what-do-supply-and-demand-tell-us-about-todays-housing-market/)&nbsp;of homes for sale as we move into the end of the year.

#### **The Number of Homes for Sale Usually Peaks in the Fall**

In the residential real estate market, trends generally follow a predictable and seasonal pattern. Typically, the number of homes available for sale (or active monthly listings) peaks in the fall. But in a chapter where so little feels normal, the question becomes: should we expect a fall peak this year?

If we look at the active monthly listings for 2021 (*shown in the chart below*), we’ll see that the number of homes on the market has increased fairly steadily since spring this year. The&nbsp;*realtor.com*&nbsp;[data](https://www.realtor.com/research/data/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;shows we’re still seeing an increase in active inventory month-over-month. While that gain is a bit smaller month-to-month (*see August to September*&nbsp;*in the chart*), September numbers are still up from the month prior.The important takeaway here is&nbsp;**the latest monthly numbers show growth**. At the end of September, buyers had more options to pick from than they did this spring. That’s encouraging for buyers who may have paused their search months ago because they had trouble finding a home. Danielle Hale, Chief Economist at&nbsp;[*realtor.com*](https://news.move.com/2021-09-30-Realtor-com-R-September-Housing-Report-Inventory-Just-Hit-a-2021-High,-Which-Means-More-Choices-for-Fall-Buyers){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}, sums this up nicely:

> *“Put simply,&nbsp;**this September buyers had more options**&nbsp;**than they’ve had all year**&nbsp;and while that’s typical of early fall, that’s not what happened in 2020. Still, it’s important to remember that while buyers may have an easier time this fall than they did in the spring,**&nbsp;the market remains more competitive than it has been historically at this time of year**.”**&nbsp;*

As Hale says, a fall peak in inventory is in line with typical seasonal trends. While it’s impossible to say for certain what the future holds for housing inventory, we do know both buyers and sellers have opportunities this season based on the latest data.

#### **What Does That Mean for You?**

If you’re thinking of buying a home, rest assured you do have more options now than you did earlier this year – and that’s a welcome relief. That said, today’s market is still highly competitive. This isn’t the time to slow your search. It’s actually the season when the number of homes available for sale tends to peak. Focus on the additional options with renewed energy this season and be prepared for&nbsp;[ongoing competition](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/5-tips-for-making-your-best-offer/)&nbsp;from other buyers.

If you’re considering selling your house, realize that while growing,&nbsp;[inventory](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/sellers-your-house-could-be-an-oasis-for-buyers-seeking-more-options/)&nbsp;is still low.&nbsp;[Selling now](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/its-still-a-sellers-market/)&nbsp;means you’ll be in a great position to negotiate with buyers – and competition among buyers is good news for your bottom line. Eager buyers will likely be motivated to act before the holidays, giving you the benefit of a fast sale.

### **Bottom Line**

Whether you’re buying or selling, there’s still a chance to make your goals a reality this season. Let’s connect so we can discuss what’s going on with the local market and current trends and what they mean for you.
