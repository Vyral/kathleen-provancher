# Why Today’s Sellers Rely on Real Estate Professionals

&nbsp;

You may have thought about selling your home on your own as a For Sale by Owner (FSBO). However, with the current changes in the housing market, more and more homeowners are realizing it’s just not worth the risk.

In fact, the latest data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) shows that the number of people selling without an agent is now at an all-time low (see graph below):

**Thinking of Selling Without an Agent? Here’s Why You Might Want to Reconsider.**

While only a small percentage of homeowners choose to go the For Sale By Owner (FSBO) route, most of them aren’t totally confident in that decision. In fact, a recent survey shows that **3 out of 4 sellers who don’t plan to use an agent still question if it’s the right move.**

Here’s why that hesitation makes sense:<br>The real estate market is shifting—not in a negative way, but in a way that requires **more strategy, expertise, and precision.** Having a skilled agent in your corner can make all the difference.

Here are just **a few key ways** working with a professional gives you an edge:

---

### 1\. Pricing It Right in a Changing Market

One of the toughest parts of selling on your own is setting the right price. It’s not about guessing or going off what a neighbor got last year. Today’s market requires **real-time data and local insight** to nail that perfect price point.

As Zillow puts it:

> “Agents are pros when it comes to pricing properties and have their finger on the pulse of your local market.”

Agents know what buyers are actually paying, what’s really selling, and how to position your home to stand out. **That knowledge can be the difference between sitting on the market or getting top dollar fast.**

### 2\. Navigating the Legal Side Like a Pro

Selling a home involves a lot of paperwork—disclosures, contracts, addendums, contingencies. One small mistake can lead to **major legal or financial headaches**.

An experienced agent knows what every document means, what’s required, and how to **protect your interests every step of the way.** With more buyers requesting contingencies and concessions again, guidance from someone who’s been through it all is invaluable.

### 3\. Selling Quickly, Even as Inventory Grows

With more homes hitting the market, it’s no longer guaranteed your home will sell overnight. But with the right marketing strategy, it still can.

The truth is, **agents have access to networks, tools, and platforms** most homeowners simply don’t. That kind of exposure—and a solid plan—can help your home sell faster and for more money.

### Bottom Line

You don’t have to do this alone. In a market that’s evolving, **the right agent brings clarity, strategy, and peace of mind.** Let’s connect so you can list with confidence and have expert support from day one.
