# Focus on the Most Important Rooms When Selling Your Home

With more homes available on the market today, it’s important to be intentional about how your home is presented to potential buyers. One powerful way to make a lasting impression is through home staging.

**What Is Home Staging?**<br>Home staging isn’t about making your space look like a magazine cover — it’s about creating a warm, inviting environment that allows buyers to easily imagine themselves living there.

Staging can range from small updates to full-room transformations, depending on your goals and budget. Even minimal changes can have a big impact. In today’s competitive market, the time and effort you put into staging can truly pay off.

According to a study by the National Association of Realtors (NAR), staged homes tend to sell faster and at a higher price than those that aren’t staged (see data below):

**Which Rooms Have the Biggest Impact?**<br>The good news? You likely don’t need to stage your entire home to impress buyers. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), these are the rooms where staging makes the most significant difference (see graph below):

**What Spaces Matter Most When Staging?**<br>Agents who regularly work with buyers agree—the most important rooms to stage are the ones where buyers envision themselves spending the most time, like the living room, primary bedroom, and kitchen.

While this can give you a helpful starting point, nothing compares to the insight of a local real estate expert.

**Why Having an Agent’s Guidance Matters**<br>Local agents know exactly what buyers in your area are looking for because they’re constantly hearing real-time feedback during showings, open houses, and conversations with other agents. That insight allows them to evaluate your home and pinpoint which spaces may benefit from light staging. For example, they might suggest:

* Decluttering and removing personal photos or memorabilia
* Rearranging furniture to improve flow and maximize space
* Adding greenery, updating wall art, or reworking small decor pieces

Sometimes, this simple guidance is all you need. But if your home is vacant or needs a more noticeable transformation, your agent can also help determine whether hiring a professional stager is worth the investment.

According to NAR:

> “The median dollar value spent when using a staging service was $1,500, compared to $500 when the seller’s agent personally staged the home.”

Your agent will help you weigh the potential return on investment based on your budget, your timeline, the condition of your home, and how similar homes are performing in your local market.

**The Takeaway**<br>Staging doesn’t have to be extravagant or expensive—it just needs to create a space where buyers can picture themselves living. A trusted agent will guide you toward the right level of staging that aligns with your goals.
