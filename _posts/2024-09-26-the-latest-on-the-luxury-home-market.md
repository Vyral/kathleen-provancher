Luxury living is about more than just stunning views and cutting-edge smart home technology—it's about elevating your lifestyle. And if you're in the market for a million-dollar home, now is an excellent time to explore the thriving luxury market. Here's why.

#### **The Number of Luxury Homes Is Growing**

The top of the market, or luxury homes, can mean different things depending on where you live. But in general, these are homes that are in the top 5% price range in any area. According to a recent [report](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/million-dollar-homes-in-america-5f2b4f04){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} from *Redfin*, the average value of those homes has risen to over one million dollars:

> *“The median sale price for U.S. luxury homes, defined as the top 5% of listings, rose 9% year-over-year to a record **$1.18 million** during the second quarter.”*

That same report goes on to show the percentage of homes valued at a million dollars or more has risen to an all-time high (*see graph below*):

#### **Your Luxury Home Is an Investment**

In addition, a luxury home could help you build significant long-term wealth. * * As the *Redfin* quote mentioned earlier says, luxury home prices are rising. That may be the reason there are a lot of people investing in luxury real estate right now. [According](https://www.luxuryhomemarketing.com/assets/LMR_NorthAmerica.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"} to the August *Luxury Market Report*:

> *“By the end of July, the overall growth in the volume of sales in 2024 stood at 14.82% for single-family homes and 11.35% for attached homes compared to the same period in 2023.”*
