A lot has changed over the past year. For many people, the rise in remote work influenced what they’re looking for in a home and created a greater appetite for a dedicated home office. Some professionals&nbsp;[took advantage](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/5-reasons-todays-housing-market-is-anything-but-normal/)&nbsp;of the situation and purchased a bigger home. Other people thought working from home would be temporary, so they&nbsp;[chose to get creative](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/08/12/the-best-use-of-time-and-money-when-it-comes-to-renovations/)&nbsp;and make the space they already had work for them. But recent headlines indicate working from home isn’t a passing fad.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

**If you’re still longing for a dedicated home office, now may be&nbsp;**[**the time**](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/why-its-still-safe-to-sell-your-home/)**&nbsp;to find the home that addresses your evolving needs.&nbsp;**More and more&nbsp;[companies are delaying](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2021/09/02/after-almost-two-years-of-working-remotely-it-will-be-nearly-impossible-to-demand-people-to-return-to-the-office/?sh=6a3689743f79){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;their plans to return to the office – others are deciding to remain fully remote permanently. According to economists from&nbsp;*Goldman Sachs*&nbsp;in a recent article from&nbsp;[*CNN*](https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/02/economy/remote-working-economy/index.html){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“Job ads increasingly offer remote work and surveys indicate that both workers and employers&nbsp;**expect work from home to remain much more common than before the pandemic**.”*<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Other experts agree. A&nbsp;[survey](https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/economist-report-future-workforce){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;conducted by&nbsp;*Upwork*&nbsp;of 1,000 hiring managers found that due to the pandemic, companies were planning more remote work now and in the years to come.&nbsp;*Upwork*&nbsp;elaborates:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“The number of remote workers in the next five years is expected to be nearly double what it was before COVID-19**\: By 2025, 36.2 million Americans will be remote, an increase of 16.8 million people from pre-pandemic rates**.”*<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

The&nbsp;[charts below](https://www.statista.com/chart/23781/remote-work-teams-departments/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;break down their findings and compare pre- and post-pandemic percentages.

### **How Does This Impact Homeowners?**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you&nbsp;[own your home](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/sellers-are-in-a-sweet-spot/), it’s important to realize that continued remote work may give you opportunities you didn’t realize you had. Since you don’t need to be tied to a specific area for your job, you have more flexibility when it comes to where you can live.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **If you’re one of the nearly 23% of workers who will remain 100% remote:&nbsp;**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

You have the option to move to a lower cost-of-living area or to the location of your dreams. If you search for a home in a more affordable area, you’ll be able to get more home for your money, freeing up more options for your dedicated office space and additional breathing room.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

You could also move to a location where you’ve always wanted to live – somewhere near the beach, the mountains, or simply a market that features the kind of weather and community amenities you’re looking for. Without your job tying you to a specific location, you’re bound to find your ideal spot.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **If you’re one of the almost 15% of individuals who will have a partially remote or hybrid schedule:**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Relocating within your local area to a home that’s further away from your office could be a great choice. Since you won’t be going in to work every day, a slightly longer commute from a more suburban or rural neighborhood may be a worthy trade-off for a home with more features, space, or comforts.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

### **Bottom Line**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

If ongoing remote work is changing what you need in a home, let’s connect to find one that delivers on your new wish list.
