In today’s real estate market, buyers shouldn’t shop for a home with the expectation they’ll be able to negotiate a lower sales price. In a typical housing market, buyers try to determine how much less than the asking price they can offer and still get the home. From there, the buyer and seller typically negotiate and agree on a revised price somewhere in the middle.

## **Things Are Different Today**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Today’s housing market is anything but normal. According to the&nbsp;[*National Association of Realtors*](https://cdn.nar.realtor/sites/default/files/documents/2021-08-realtors-conference-index-09-22-2021_0.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;(NAR), homes today are:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:list -->

* Receiving an average of&nbsp; 3.8 offers
* Selling in just 17 days<!-- /wp:list --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Homes selling quickly and receiving multiple offers highlights how competitive the&nbsp;[housing market](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/5-reasons-todays-housing-market-is-anything-but-normal/)&nbsp;is right now. This is due, in large part, to the low supply of homes for sale. Low supply and high demand mean homes often sell for more than the asking price. In some cases, they sell for a lot more. Selma Hepp, Deputy Chief Economist at*&nbsp;CoreLogic*,&nbsp;[explains](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/find-stories/us-sp-corelogic-case-shiller-rockets-to-16-6-reaches-new-records/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;how these stats can impact buyers:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“The imbalance between robust demand and dismal availability of for-sale homes has led to a continual bidding over asking prices, which reached record levels in recent months.&nbsp;**Now, almost 6 in 10 homes listed are selling over the asking price.”***<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:heading -->

## **You May Need To Rethink How You Look at a Home’s Asking Price**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

What does that mean for you? If you’ve found your dream home, you need to be realistic about today’s housing market and how that impacts the offer you’ll make. Offering below or even at a home’s asking price may not cut it. In&nbsp;[today’s market](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/5-reasons-todays-housing-market-is-anything-but-normal/), the highest bidder often wins the home, much like at an auction.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Currently, the asking price is often the floor of the negotiation rather than the ceiling. If you really love a home, it may ultimately sell for more than the sellers are asking. That’s important to keep in mind as you work with your agent to craft an offer.

## **Understand An Appraisal Gap Can Happen**<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

Because of today’s home price appreciation and the auction-like atmosphere in the selling process, appraisal gaps – the gap between the price of your contract and the appraisal for the house – are more frequent.
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

According to data from&nbsp;[*CoreLogic*](https://www.corelogic.com/intelligence/appraisal-gap-increases-in-hot-markets/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“Beginning in January 2020, nationally, 7% of purchase transactions had a contract price above the appraisal,&nbsp;**but by May 2021, the frequency had increased to 19% of purchase transactions.”***<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

When this happens, your lender won’t loan you more than the home’s appraised value, and the seller may ask you to make up the difference out of pocket. Buyers in today’s market need to be prepared for this possibility. Know your budget, know what you can afford, and work with a&nbsp;[trust](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/14/the-right-expert-will-guide-you-through-this-unprecedented-market/)[e](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/how-the-right-expert-can-help-you-through-the-overwhelming-market/)[d advisor](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/06/14/the-right-expert-will-guide-you-through-this-unprecedented-market/)&nbsp;who can offer expert advice along the way.
