# Turn Your Home Equity Into a Legacy: Help Your Children Buy Their First Home

If you’re a homeowner, you may be sitting on a powerful asset: your home equity. As your home has appreciated in value over the years, you’ve likely built up substantial wealth—simply by living in your home.

In today’s market, many first-time buyers face affordability challenges, even with steady incomes and well-laid plans. For many, homeownership can still feel just out of reach. But your equity could be the key that opens the door for them.

To put it in perspective, the average homeowner with a mortgage has around **$311,000** in equity, according to Cotality (formerly CoreLogic). That’s a game-changing figure. More and more parents are tapping into a portion of their equity to help their children purchase a home.

In fact, a recent study from Bank of America shows that **49% of buyers aged 18 to 26** received financial help from their parents for their down payment (see chart below).

While the data doesn’t reveal exactly how many parents have tapped into their home equity to support their children, it’s clear that the wealth built through homeownership may have played a key role—especially considering the substantial equity many homeowners have today.

Every family’s situation is different, but one thing remains true: using equity to help the next generation purchase a home can be a powerful and lasting legacy. It can give young buyers a meaningful head start—reducing financial pressure and laying the groundwork for long-term stability. And for the parents who provide that support, it’s a way to turn years of building equity into something deeply personal and impactful.

This isn’t just a financial decision. For many, it’s about being the reason their child can proudly say, *“We got the house.”* It’s about giving them the opportunity that may have once felt out of reach.

Here’s what really stands out:<br>According to Compare the Market,<br>**“Of those who received financial help from parents or grandparents, 45% said they wouldn’t have been able to buy a home without it.”**

**Bottom Line:**<br>Your home equity could be the key that opens the door to homeownership for your children. If making that dream a reality is more possible than you thought, would you be open to exploring it?
