There’s a common misconception that younger generations aren’t interested in homeownership. Many people point to the fact that millennials put off purchasing their first home as a reason for this belief.

Odeta Kushi, Deputy Chief Economist for&nbsp;*First American*,&nbsp;[explains](https://blog.firstam.com/economics/pandemic-accelerated-roaring-20s-of-millennial-homeownership-demand){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;why millennials have put off certain milestones linked to homeownership. Those delays led to their homeownership rates trailing slightly behind older generations:

> *“**Historically, millennials have delayed the critical lifestyle choices often**&nbsp;**linked to buying a first home,&nbsp;**including getting married and having children, in order to further their education**. This is clear in cross-generational comparisons of homeownership rates which show millennials lagging their generational predecessors.”***

So, it’s partially true that&nbsp;**some millennials&nbsp;*have waited&nbsp;*on**&nbsp;[**homeownership**](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/the-truths-young-homebuyers-need-to-hear/)**&nbsp;to focus on other things in their lives**&nbsp;– and that’s impacting certain housing market trends.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Data from the&nbsp;[*National Association of Realtors*](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pandemic-caused-buyers-to-seek-multi-generational-homes-sellers-to-sell-faster){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;(NAR) indicates&nbsp;**the average age of a first-time homebuyer is higher today than it’s been over the past 40 years**. As the graph below shows, homebuyers today are purchasing their first home**&nbsp;an average of**&nbsp;**4 years later&nbsp;**than people in the 1980s and early 1990s:But just because millennials are hitting certain milestones later in life&nbsp;**doesn’t mean they’re not interested in becoming homeowners**. The recent&nbsp;[U.S. Census](https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;reveals a significant&nbsp;**increase in homeownership rates for millennials and other young homebuyers**.As the graph above shows, millennials are entering the market in full force, and their share of the market is growing. Based on the data,&nbsp;**the belief that younger generations don’t want to buy homes is a misconception.&nbsp;**In fact, the recent&nbsp;[*Capital Market Outlook*](https://olui2.fs.ml.com/Publish/Content/application/pdf/GWMOL/CMO_4-26-21_Merrill.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;report from&nbsp;*Merrill-Lynch*&nbsp;further drives home this point, as it specifically mentions the effect millennials are having on demand:

> *“Demand is very strong because the&nbsp;**biggest demographic cohort in history is moving through the household-formation and peak home-buying stages of its life cycle**.”*

Kushi is following the trend of millennial homeownership and puts it more simply,&nbsp;[saying](https://twitter.com/odetakushi/status/1420030874872074252){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“. . .&nbsp;**it’s clear that younger households (millennials\!) are driving homeownership growth**.”*

As the largest generation, millennials’ impact on the market is growing as more and more people from that generation reach homebuying age – and Generation Z isn’t far behind, either. That means younger generations will likely continue to&nbsp;[drive demand](https://www.buyandsellvero.com/blog/diving-deep-into-todays-biggest-buyer-concerns/)&nbsp;in the housing market for years to come.

### **Summary**

If you’re a member of a younger generation and interested in purchasing a home, you’re not alone. Many of your peers are on their path to homeownership, too. Let’s connect today and discuss what you can do to accomplish your homebuying goals.
