The first half of the year has been a rollercoaster ride for the Real Estate Market. As we move into the latter half of the year, a lot of questions about what’s to come are top of mind for buyers and sellers. Near record-low mortgage rates and housing inventory partnered with rising home price appreciation made the market volatile and unpredictable throughout the first half of 2021. What does this mean as we move to the second half of the year?

## **Mortgage Rates Will Likely Increase, but Remain Low**

Many experts are projecting a rise in interest rates. The latest&nbsp;*Quarterly Forecast*&nbsp;from&nbsp;*Freddie Mac*&nbsp;[states](http://www.freddiemac.com/research/forecast/20210414_quarterly_economic_forecast.page){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“**We forecast that**&nbsp;**mortgage rates will continue to rise through the end of next year.**&nbsp;We estimate the 30-year fixed mortgage rate will average 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2021, rising to 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2022.”*

However, even as mortgage rates rise, the anticipated increase is expected to be modest at most, and still well below&nbsp;[historical averages](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/03/09/how-upset-should-you-be-about-3-mortgage-rates/). Rates remaining low is good news for homebuyers who are looking to maximize their&nbsp;[purchasing power](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/03/30/how-a-change-in-mortgage-rate-impacts-your-homebuying-budget). The same report from&nbsp;*Freddie Mac&nbsp;*goes on to say:

> *“While higher mortgage rates will help slow the pace of home sales and moderate house price growth,&nbsp;**we expect overall housing market activity will remain robust.**&nbsp;Our forecast has total home sales, the sum of new and existing home sales, at 7.1 million in 2021….”*

## **Home Price Appreciation Will Continue, but Price Growth Will Likely Slow**

Joe Seydl, Senior Markets Economist at&nbsp;*J.P. Morgan*,&nbsp;[projects](https://privatebank.jpmorgan.com/gl/en/insights/living/do-you-want-to-jump-into-the-us-housing-market){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;home prices to continue rising as well, indicating buyers interested in purchasing a home should do so sooner rather than later. Waiting for rates or home prices to fall may not be wise:

> *“Homebuyers—interest rates are still historically low, though they are inching up. Housing prices have spiked during the last six-to-nine months,&nbsp;**but we don’t expect them to fall soon, and we believe they are more likely to keep rising.**&nbsp;If you are looking to purchase a new home, conditions now may be better than 12 months hence.”*

Other experts remain optimistic about home prices, too. An average of 8.9% increase is forecasted by several experts moving forward.

#### **Inventory Remains a Challenge, but There’s Reason To Be Optimistic**

Home prices are rising, but they should moderate as more housing inventory comes to market. George Ratiu, Senior Economist at&nbsp;*realtor.com*,&nbsp;[notes](https://www.realtor.com/research/weekly-housing-trends-view-data-week-june-19-2021/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}&nbsp;there are signs that we may see the current inventory challenges lessen, slowing the fast-paced home price appreciation and creating more choices for buyers:

> *“**We have seen more new listings this year compared with 2020 in 11 of the last 13 weeks**. The influx of new sellers over the last couple of months has been especially helpful in slowing price gains.”*

New home starts are also showing signs of improvement, which further bolsters hopes of more options coming to market. Robert Dietz, Chief Economist at the&nbsp;*National Association of Home Builders&nbsp;*(NAHB),&nbsp;[writes](https://eyeonhousing.org/2021/06/single-family-starts-steady-in-may/){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“As an indicator of the economic impact of housing, there are now&nbsp;**652,000 single-family homes under construction. This is 28% higher than a year ago.”***

Finally, while it may not fundamentally change the market conditions we’re currently experiencing, another reason to be optimistic more homes might come to market: our improving economy. Mark Fleming, Chief Economist at&nbsp;*First American,*&nbsp;[notes](https://blog.firstam.com/economics/why-housing-market-potential-strengthened-in-april){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

> *“A growing economy in the summer months has multiple implications for the housing market. Growing consumer confidence, a stronger labor market, and higher wages bode well for housing demand**. While a growing economy and improving public health conditions may also spur hesitant existing owners to list their homes for sale, it’s unlikely to significantly ease the super sellers’ market conditions.**”*
