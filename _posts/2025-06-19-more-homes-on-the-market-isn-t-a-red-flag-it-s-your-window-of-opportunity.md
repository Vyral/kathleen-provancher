# More Homes on the Market Isn’t a Red Flag – It’s Your Window of Opportunity

You may have heard that the number of homes for sale is climbing, and that might spark concern—is this a sign of another housing crash?

The short answer: no. In fact, the data tells a very different story. In many areas, rising inventory is actually a positive sign that the housing market is becoming more balanced and healthy.

**So, What’s Really Happening With Inventory?**<br>According to the latest data from Realtor.com, housing inventory has reached its highest point since 2020 (shown by the white line in the chart below).

But here’s what’s important to understand: even with this increase, inventory is still below where it was before the pandemic (indicated in gray). That means we’re still not back to typical market conditions—yet we’re moving in the right direction.

**More Homes Are Hitting the Market — But Don’t Let That Mislead You**<br>There are currently more homes for sale than we’ve seen in quite some time. While this marks a notable increase from recent years, it’s crucial to understand that overall inventory still falls well below normal historical levels. That context matters.

**Why This Isn’t Another 2008**<br>When people hear that inventory is rising, some worry we’re heading toward a repeat of the 2008 housing crash. But today’s market is fundamentally different.

The reason? We’re not dealing with a glut of homes — we’re still working through a major shortage. For over a decade, new home construction hasn’t kept pace with the number of households being formed. That has created a significant housing deficit.

The red bars in the graph below represent the years since 2012 when new home construction lagged behind household growth. The deeper the red, the larger the shortfall — and the more it illustrates the long-term imbalance we're still trying to correct.

One of the main reasons the housing shortage has continued to grow is because new home construction hasn’t kept pace with buyer demand. The U.S. is now short by millions of homes, and closing that gap won’t happen overnight. According to Realtor.com:

> “At a 2024 rate of construction relative to household formations and pent-up demand, it would take 7.5 years to close the housing gap.”

This means that in most markets, we’re far from having too many homes. In fact, most areas still desperately need more inventory.

So even though the number of homes for sale is increasing, it’s not a bad sign—it’s simply helping to address a long-standing shortage.

**Bottom Line:**<br>Don’t let the headlines fool you. Rising inventory isn’t a crash—it’s a move toward a healthier, more balanced housing market.
