Mortgage rates are one of several factors that impact how much you can afford if you’re buying a home. When rates are low, they help you get more house for your money. Within the last year, mortgage rates have hit the&nbsp;[lowest point](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/10/12/dont-wait-for-a-lower-mortgage-rate-it-could-cost-you/)&nbsp;ever recorded, and they’ve hovered in the historic-low territory. But even over the past few weeks,&nbsp;[rates](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/10/05/the-main-key-to-understanding-the-rise-in-mortgage-rates/)&nbsp;have started to rise. This past week, the average 30-year fixed rate was&nbsp;[3\.14%](https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/node/23986/pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

What does this mean if you’re thinking about making a move?&nbsp;**Waiting until next year will cost you more in the long run**. Here’s a look at what several experts project for mortgage rates going into 2022.

<!-- /wp:paragraph --><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### [*Freddie Mac*](http://www.freddiemac.com/fmac-resources/research/pdf/Quarterly_Forecast_October2021_Press_Release.pdf){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage (FRM) is expected to be&nbsp;**3\.0 percent in 2021 and 3.5 percent in 2022**.”*

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### Doug Duncan, Senior VP & Chief Economist,&nbsp;[*Fannie Mae*](https://www.fanniemae.com/newsroom/fannie-mae-news/economic-growth-again-revised-downward-due-supply-chain-and-inflation-concerns){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“Right now,&nbsp;**we forecast mortgage rates to average 3.3 percent in 2022**, which, though slightly higher than 2020 and 2021, by historical standards remains extremely low and supportive of mortgage demand and affordability.”&nbsp;*

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:heading {"level":4} -->

#### [*First American*](https://www.firstam.com/news/2021/rising-rates-dull-house-buying-power-20211026.html){: target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"}\:

<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:quote -->

> *“Consensus forecasts predict that mortgage rates will hit&nbsp;**3\.2 percent by the end of the year, and 3.7 percent by the end of 2022**.”*

<!-- /wp:quote --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

If rates rise even a half-point percentage over the next year, it will impact what you pay each month over the life of your loan – and that can really add up. So, the reality is, as&nbsp;[prices](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/10/19/what-does-the-future-hold-for-home-prices/)&nbsp;and mortgage rates rise, it will cost more to purchase a home.

As you can see from the quotes above, industry experts project rates will rise in the months ahead. Here’s a table that compares other expert views and gives an average of those projections:Whether you’re thinking about buying your first home, moving up to your dream home, or downsizing because your needs have&nbsp;[changed](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/09/20/is-it-time-to-move-on-to-a-new-home/), purchasing before mortgage rates rise even higher will help you take advantage of today’s homebuying&nbsp;[affordability](https://www.mykcm.com/2021/10/21/important-distinction-homes-are-less-affordable-not-unaffordable/). That could be just the game-changer you need to achieve your homeownership goals.

### **Bottom Line**

<!-- /wp:heading --><!-- wp:paragraph -->

If you’re thinking of buying or selling over the next year, it may be wise to make your move sooner rather than later – before mortgage rates climb higher.
